# Memento Mori - A Reminder of Your Own Mortality

Inspired by the [WeCroak](https://www.wecroak.com/) app.

Sign up to receive push notifications at somewhat random intervals of time (between 4 and 14 days) that say "A reminder that you aren't going to live forever." - a reminder to make the most out of life.

### Learning Goals

I wanted to learn about implementing the [Push API](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-push-notifications) PWA technology. So it was important to have an application that would need to send push notifications even if the app is not open and active.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
