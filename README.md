# Memento Mori - A Reminder of Your Own Mortality

Inspired by the [WeCroak](https://www.wecroak.com/) app.

Sign up to receive push notifications at somewhat random intervals of time (between 4 and 14 days) that say "A reminder that you aren't going to live forever." - a reminder to make the most out of life.

**See the [Backend Application Repository](https://github.com/robbiejaeger/memento-mori) for more information about the app.**
